In the HTML, there was a commented out form, containing a "captcha".
Analyzing the dynamically generated image using the guess^d^d^d^d^d stegano tool "stegsolve", I noticed an equation written out using the lowest bit of the green channel.
Also, there was a suspicious straight line of pixels.
I concluded that the equation determines that line, analyzing the line of pixels resulted in an ASCII-string encoded in the color values.
Submitting this ASCII-string let me pass into the next stage.

I however noticed that none of this was actually neccesary, as the solution to the captcha was also contained in a JWT in the cookie, which is precisely where the solution of a captcha shouldn't be.
Maybe that was the point. Maybe not.

After passing all the stages I landed on a page containing an embedded rickroll, and some javascript-obfuscated links to other rickroll or gandalf-headnod videos.
I spent some time trying to find the flag in there.
However, this turned out to be a colossal waste of my time that added absolutely nothing to the challenge - when I copied the cookie obtained by my python script into my actual browser, I just got randomly redirected to the flag page in a matter that didn't seem consistent.
