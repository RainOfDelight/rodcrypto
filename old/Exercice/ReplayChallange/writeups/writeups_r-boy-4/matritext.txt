The pairs of files with similar filenames "xxx.txt" and "xxx (1).txt" had the same content-length and similar content, but with some characters difference.
Taking just the changed characters from the "(1)"-file resulted in another text, similar to another file in the folder.
Repeating this process resulted in "Try again!" for three of the pairs, and in the flag for the remaining one.
